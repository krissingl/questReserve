# Quest Reserve

### Problem Statement
Current dungeon raid booking systems deprecated and not built to scale. Client wishes to create a new app that can be used to organize and collect data on regional dungeon raid bookings. App will allow dungeon owners to manage their bookings, establish rulesets for their clients, and track analytics and potential dungeon marketing.
Would like to have an MVP deployed before the start of the busy season to maximize profits and protect stakeholder interests.
### Potential Users
* WizardsTowerCorp Employees (Client)
    * Admin level access and dashboard feature for tracking booking analytics and managing marketing for dungeon owner clients.
* Dungeon Owner Providers
    * Admin level for their own portal access to manage their bookings, establish rulesets for their clients, and track analytics. Potential dungeon marketing may be a feature they can purchase separately. Payment managed through the site.
* Adventure Parties Customers
    * Can browser available Dungeon reservations and schedules and book their party for a raid. Can view and manage their bookings through a login portal.
